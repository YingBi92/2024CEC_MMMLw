<p>Machine learning is an important research area and has become increasingly popular in various fields, such as security, engineering, sciences, finance, marketing, healthcare, and marketing. Machine learning covers a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and semisupervised tasks such as regression, classification, clustering, ensemble learning, and feature selection. Many issues or challenges, such as generalizability, interpretability, robustness, security, privacy, and data scarcity, require the development of new machine learning algorithms that can provide effective solutions.</p> 

<p>Evolutionary Computation (EC) includes a family of nature-inspired population-based algorithms/techniques, including Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP). Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMO). EC techniques have promising global search ability to find high-quality solutions to problems without requiring rich domain knowledge and differential objective functions. EC techniques have been widely applied for many tasks in the fields of engineering, economics, finance, manufacturing, management, etc.</p>

<p> Multimodal optimization is a subfield of EC, which aims to develop veracious EC techniques with powerful search ability to find multiple (nearly) optimal solutions in a single run for an optimization problem. In many real-world scenarios, it is necessary to have multiple solutions with similar performance for better use. To find multiple solutions, many new strategies have been proposed in EC methods to enhance their global and local search ability, such as niching, parallel computing, multi-population, multitasking, etc.</p> 

<p>In machine learning, there are many optimization problems requiring powerful search techniques. EC methods have also been widely applied to machine learning problems, including feature selection, ensemble combination, classifier generation, and parameter optimization. However, due to the different requirements in terms of model accuracy. complexity, interpretability, etc, it is valuable to find multiple solutions in machine learning, which are promising for future use. For example, in feature selection, if the methods can find multiple optimal feature subsets, the end users will have more choices in terms of which subset is more applicable based on different criteria. However, the potential of multimodal optimization for machine learning has not been comprehensively explored. It is necessary to develop new multimodal optimization approaches for machine learning.</p>
