<p>Machine learning is an important research area and has become increasingly popular in various fields, such as security, engineering, sciences, finance, marketing, healthcare, and marketing. Machine learning covers a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and semisupervised tasks such as regression, classification, clustering, ensemble learning, and feature selection. Many issues or challenges, such as generalizability, interpretability, robustness, security, privacy, and data scarcity, require the development of new machine learning algorithms that can provide effective solutions.</p> 

<p>Evolutionary Computation (EC) includes a family of nature-inspired population-based algorithms/techniques, including Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP). Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMO). EC techniques have promising global search ability to find high-quality solutions to problems without requiring rich domain knowledge and differential objective functions. EC techniques have been widely applied for many tasks in the fields of engineering, economics, finance, manufacturing, management, etc.</p>

<p> Multimodal optimization is a subfield of EC, which aims to develop veracious EC techniques with powerful search ability to find multiple (nearly) optimal solutions in a single run for an optimization problem. In many real-world scenarios, it is necessary to have multiple solutions with similar performance for better use. To find multiple solutions, many new strategies have been proposed in EC methods to enhance their global and local search ability, such as niching, parallel computing, multi-population, multitasking, etc.</p> 

<p>In machine learning, there are many optimization problems requiring powerful search techniques. EC methods have also been widely applied to machine learning problems, including feature selection, ensemble combination, classifier generation, and parameter optimization. However, due to the different requirements in terms of model accuracy. complexity, interpretability, etc, it is valuable to find multiple solutions in machine learning, which are promising for future use. For example, in feature selection, if the methods can find multiple optimal feature subsets, the end users will have more choices in terms of which subset is more applicable based on different criteria. However, the potential of multimodal optimization for machine learning has not been comprehensively explored. It is necessary to develop new multimodal optimization approaches for machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Tilte:</b>Heterogeneous multi-objective optimization</p>
<p><b>Abstract: </b>Multiobjective optimization problems whose objectives have different evaluation costs are commonly seen in the real world. Such problems are now known as multiobjective optimization problems with heterogeneous objectives (HEMOPs). So far, however, only a few studies have been reported on addressing HE-MOPs, and most of them focus on biobjective problems with one fast objective and one slow objective. In this work, we aim to deal with HE-MOPs having more than two black-box and heterogeneous objectives. To this end, we develop a multiobjective Bayesian evolutionary optimization (BEO) approach to HE-MOPs that can alleviate search biases resulting from the different numbers of function evaluations allowed for the cheap and expensive objectives.</p>

<p><b>Tilte:</b>Learning Improvement Representations to Accelerate Evolutionary Complex Multiobjective Optimization</p>
<p><b>Abstract: </b>Evolutionary algorithms are highly effective for solving complex optimization problems, especially those involving multiple objectives. However, their significant computational demands and inherent stochasticity can slow down convergence to global optima, particularly in intricate scenarios. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to accelerate the convergence of complex multi-objective optimization problems through learning improvement representations. Our proposed methods involve training a neural model to learn performance improvement representations of solutions in various optimization contexts, including large-scale, dynamic, and constrained multi-objective optimization. By analyzing transitions between suboptimal and superior solutions, the model captures critical insights into performance improvements. We then design various learnable evolutionary generators guided by these learned improvement representations. These generators produce higher-quality offspring solutions by concurrently exploring the learned representation spaces. This approach accelerates the population’s convergence toward global optimality, steering the search process in more promising directions and enhancing overall efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Tilte:</b> Solving Multi-solution Problems in Machine Learning via Evolutionary Computation</p>
<p><b>Abstract: </b>Machine learning (ML) methods have obtained great success across a number of practical applications and attracted growing interest. How to improve learning performance has emerged as a prominent research area. In ML, the identification of multiple optimal or near-optimal solutions/models (i.e., multi-solution characteristics) is a common preference of many users. Examples include finding all possible structures in a protein prediction problem or providing multiple-diagnostic methods in disease prediction. In this talk, I will discuss how evolutionary computation methods especially niching techniques and multimodal multi-objective optimization are used to find multiple optimal or near-optimal solutions/models for a learning task. The multi-solution characteristics of a learning task is emphasized and analyzed. Also, our talk will discuss key challenges and provide insights into potential emerging directions in this field.</p>

<p>  <b>Tilte:</b>Evolutionary computation for identifying biomarkers of individual patients in cancer
Evolutionary computation for identifying biomarkers of individual patients in cancer
</p>
<p><b>Abstract: </b> With the advancement of high-throughput sequencing technology, there has been a significant increase in the volume of known cancer omics data, where many methods have been developed to identify potential biomarkers for mining the complex dynamics. As emerging artificial intelligence techniques, evolutionary computation has found extensive application in the identification of biomarkers. However, the high dimension and complex dynamics of biomarkers in omics data pose a big challenge to apply EC for mining cancer omics data. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to identify predictive and prognostic biomarkers in cancer by combining multimodal optimization and multiobjective optimization and network science. On one hand, several algorithms (denoted MMPDNB and MMPDNB-RBM) based on a multimodal optimization mechanism and personalized dynamic network biomarker theory, which can provide multiple modules of personalized biomarkers and unveil their multi-modal properties of node and edge module biomarkers. On the other hand, we proposed multi-objective optimization based structural network control principlesby considering minimum driver nodes and maximum prior-known drug target information. Subsequently, several methods including LSCV-MCEA, LSCV-TSEA and SNCPDTs were developed by adapting knowledge-embedded multitasking constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. </p>
